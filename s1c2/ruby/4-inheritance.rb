# ================================
# inheritance
#
# classes can inherit values and
# behavior from another class. this
# is one of the primary strengths
# of object oriented programming.

# simple inheritance
# ================================
  class Animal # Animals can move
    def move
      puts 'moving...'
    end
  end

  class Bird < Animal # a Bird is an animal
    def fly
      puts 'flying...'
    end
  end
  
  roy = Bird.new # Birds can move and fly
  roy.move
  roy.fly
